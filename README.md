# Predictive Analysis: Telcom"s Company Customer Churn

## Introduction
Aim to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to when customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting churn can help businesses understand customer behavior and develop strategies to retain customers.

## Data
We use the Telco Customer Churn dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

## Project Workflow
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure and features.
   - Perform data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
   
2. Model Building and Evaluation
   - Build machine learning models to predict customer churn.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   
3. Model Comparison
   - Compare the performance of different machine learning models.
   
4. Hyperparameter Tuning & Feature Engineering
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
   - Explore feature engineering techniques such as polynomial features.
