# Predictive Analysis: Telecommunications' Company Customer Churn

## Overview
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and related resources for analyzing customer churn in the telecommunications industry using the Telco Customer Churn dataset obtained from Kaggle. The project encompasses data exploration, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and comparison of various machine learning models. Additionally, it includes hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering to optimize model performance

## Data
We use the Telco Customer Churn dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

## Project Workflow
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure and features.
   - Perform data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
   
2. Model Building and Evaluation
   - Build machine learning models to predict customer churn.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   
3. Model Comparison
   - Compare the performance of different machine learning models.
   
4. Hyperparameter Tuning & Feature Engineering
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
   - Explore feature engineering techniques such as polynomial features.
